## Overview

This workshop is focused on the art and science of prompt engineeringâ€”how to design, structure, and refine prompts to get the most effective responses from AI systems.

## Key Elements of a Good Prompt

1. **Context:** Provide background information or specify the domain.
2. **Role:** Assign a role (e.g., "You are a doctor," "You are a software engineer," "You are a QA engineer").
3. **Constraints:** Set word limits, output format, and tone.
4. **Instructions:** Clearly define what needs to be done.
5. **Examples:** Provide sample inputs and outputs to guide the AI response.
6. **Chain of Thought:** Encourage AI to think step-by-step before giving the final answer.
